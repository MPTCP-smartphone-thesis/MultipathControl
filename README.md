This project was initially created by Gregory Detal (http://github.com/gdetal),
but most of the current code was contributed by Matthieu Baerts (http://github.com/matttbe)
and Quentin De Coninck (http://github.com/qdeconinck) for a thesis about MPTCP and Smartphones
and supervised by Pr. O. Bonaventure (http://github.com/obonaventure).

Thanks to Carmen Alvarez for his Network-Monitor project! It was useful for the logging part.
